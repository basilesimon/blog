<p>At the 2013 edition of the Bayeux Festival of war correspondents, 9 out of 10 prized works were done in Syria. This absence of diversity in the selection asks the question of the coverage of wars in the world.</p>
<p>The above map represents the winners of prestigious awards during these last 10 years. I chose to represent the laureates of the <a href="www.worldpressphoto.org">World Press Photo</a>, the<a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/Breaking-News-Photography"> Pulitzer prize for Breaking News Photography</a> and <a href="http://www.pulitzer.org/bycat/International-Reporting">International Reporting</a>, and the <a href="http://www.prixbayeux.org/english/">Bayeux award</a> in Print and in Photography.<br />
These prices were chosen among others for they represent the categories in which the war journalists enter. I would be happy to update the map if you can think of an international distinction which relates to war journalism.</p>
<p>One can't miss the huge presence of Iraq, Afghanistan and Syria. During these last 10 years, one prize out of two went to a work done in these three countries. This overwhelming importance of Afghanistan and Iraq basically are a reflection of this last decade occupied by war in Middle East.</p>

<p>I guess the obvious conclusion is that some wars are more popular than others. <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_ongoing_military_conflicts">Many other conflicts</a> are not related in the news. Does that mean that they are less interesting? Probably not. Less bloody? Nope.<br />
We know the 'mainstream media.' Do 'mainstream wars' exist?<br />
Or maybe this domination of the coverage is very simply caused by the engagement of the West in these conflicts... and the fact that the distinctions studied here are given by the West.</p>
