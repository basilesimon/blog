title: My Olympus XA is back

Yesterday, I managed to fix my dear Olympus XA. It spent the last three years in a box because its iconic red shutter release was... out of balance.

It's not a clicky button like the ones you get on DSLRs, but rather a super-sensitive (red!) surface. I tried three or four XAs, and none of them required the same touch to take a photo.

Anyway, mine didn't work anymore: it had a mind of its own, was taking photos automatically, and the lightmeter's hand, in the viewfinder, was just not working at all.

It's now fixed, and I'm very happy to get my ultimate pocket-camera back! Its lens is a work of wonder, and its rendering is just gorgeous in colour as in b&w.

Proof with some Tri-X or Portra:
