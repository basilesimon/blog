**Yes, staying nomad is harder than it seems.**

I would like to believe that my phone can replace my laptop when I'm on the go - but that is only partially true.

What happens when you have some coding to do? When you need to write a long email? When you don't have your security certificates with you to access work-related resources? When you do not normally use for your phone for PGP-encrypted emails?

**A: Unless you planned ahead, you're screwed.**

Pro-tip: You might start falling in love with the cloud. Don't.
