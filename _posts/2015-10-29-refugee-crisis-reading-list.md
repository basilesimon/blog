title: Migrant crisis reading list
---


This weekend, I'll be flying to Rome for almost two weeks of a newsgathering hackathon called the [19 Million Project](http://the19millionproject.com/) with [Sylvia](https://twitter.com/sytpp) and [Francesco](https://twitter.com/dhinus). I'll try to update this space as much as I can, but in the meantime, here's a bit of reading.

### [Migrant crisis: Migration to Europe explained in graphics](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-europe-34131911) - *BBC News*

Quite a dense piece from the BBC Visual Journalism department, with data pulled from FRONTEX, EUROSTAT, the European Commission...

### [Global refugee crisis](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/European_migrant_crisis#Global_refugee_crisis) - *Wikipedia*

In fact, the whole European Migrant Crisis page is a must-read as a well-sourced guide.

### [Syria's refugee exodus](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-24900116) - *BBC News*

An older interactive journalism piece from the BBC, focused on Syria and the correlation of the exodus with key dates of the ongoing civil war.

### [24 hours in a fuel tank](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/magazine-32152670) - *BBC Magazine*

A tough human story about what people are ready to go through to come to Europe. Part of the BBC's [Syrian Journey](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-31987373) documentary initiative.

### [Syrian Journey: Choose your own escape route](http://www.bbc.co.uk/news/world-middle-east-32057601) - *BBC World Service*

Also from the same initiative, this Visual Journalism newsgame is simply extraordinary.

### [Asylum in the EU: Facts and Figures](http://www.europarl.europa.eu/RegData/etudes/BRIE/2015/551332/EPRS_BRI%282015%29551332_EN.pdf) - *European Parliament*

EUROPARL briefing from March 2015, containing a lot of historical data.

### [The Fiscal Impact of Immigration in the UK](http://www.migrationobservatory.ox.ac.uk/briefings/fiscal-impact-immigration-uk) - *Oxford University Migration Observatory*

Spoiler: this study suggests that the fiscal impact is quite small indeed, around +/- 1% of GDP.

### [People on the Move](https://www.amnesty.org/en/what-we-do/people-on-the-move/) - *Amnesty*

A good recap of the main issues for migrants worldwide.

### [Syrian refugees start a new life in Norway through resettlement](https://www.amnesty.org/en/latest/campaigns/2015/10/syria-refugees-new-life-norway-resettlement/) - *Amnesty*

Campaigning story about Norway and an inclusive society's success.

### [Ghost Boat](https://medium.com/ghostboat) - *on Medium*

A terrific investigation-as-it-happens taking place on Medium, searching for a missing boat with 243 people on board.
