title: Responsive videos made easy
---
<p>Github is definitely a nice place to be around. Following people leads to lucky discoveries.<br />
This morning, <a href="http://twitter.com/padenot">Paul Adenot</a>, software engineer at Mozilla, and specialised in audio and video, <a href="https://github.com/padenot/talk-rich-media">published a new repo</a> with the content of his talk about rich audio and video on the web.</p>
<p>The talk can be accessed at <a href="http://padenot.github.io/talk-rich-media/">this address</a>, and it's a short delight.</p>
<p>While I was quickly going through it, I stumbled upon the slide about responsive videos without Javascript - and, of course, it rang a bell.</p>
<p><strong>Basically, CSS media queries now work on the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element.</strong></p>
<p>Without going through the codecs question (addressed earlier in the talk), you can add a media property to your HTML5 videos, like that:</p>
{% highlight html %}
<video controls>
  <source src="retina.webm" media="(min-resolution: 300dpi)"></source>
  <source src="desktop.webm" media="(min-device-width: 769px)"></source>
  <source src="mobile.webm" media="(max-device-width: 769px)"></source>
</video>
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Easy, right?<br />
<a href="http://padenot.github.io/talk-rich-media/?full#source-media">Jump to the slide</a> to see a demo, that is quite impressive.</p>
<p>That is <em>not</em> a revolution - and it's already a 2-year-old solution, but it is progress in terms of usability, simplicity, and weight.<br />
No need for that fancy Javascript looking at your browser properties and running tests: <strong>it's all in your browser, right away</strong>.<br />
<em>(Provided you use Firefox, for Chrome doesn't integrate this functionality yet.)</em></p>
