<p>No doubt here: it is difficult to focus today. I don't know about you, but between my RSS feeds, all those tweets, Hacker News... it is rare that I spend a single day without bookmarking something <em>for later</em>.</p>
<p>This new Javascript library, this yet-another-ranking-of-programming-languages blog post... I always think that I'll have time, and I rarely do. And I'm not even talking about all that other stuff.</p>
<p><a href="https://stacksocial.com/sales/increase-web-security-protection-w-the-white-hat-hacker-bundle#">Take that, for example</a>: 40 hours of good fun with computers, for $49. Web scraping, penetration testing, white-hat hacking...</p>
<p><img class="alignright wp-image-2876 size-thumbnail" src="assets/js-150x150.png" alt="js" width="150" height="150" />I should also get started with Node.js. Why? I don't know why, that's the only reason why I do not actually get on with it. Just all the hype and the desire to do back-end-ish stuff. Plus, <a href="http://www.linuxlinks.com/article/20140501050458934/NodeBooks.html">there are some great free books</a> out there.</p>
<p>I don't know about you, but I'm very bad at online courses. That's a shame, because I stumbled upon <a href="http://discover-devtools.codeschool.com/?locale=en">this <em>webinar</em></a> sponsored by the Google guys about mastering the Chrome dev tools - that I use daily. Doesn't seem that long, it just requires, well... time.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft wp-image-2877 size-medium" src="assets/piclock-300x220.jpg" alt="piclock" width="300" height="220" />And man, what about Raspberry Pi hacking? Having just a simple clock <a href="http://imgur.com/iSuh0u9">like this one</a> with infos about, I don't know, recent Twitter interactions, or BBC Breaking News alerts...<br />
But before making a useless clock, I'd go with a <a href="http://jasperproject.github.io/">Jasper</a>, a sort of Hal 9000 Pi-powered. Gotta do it when I move out (without connecting it to the pod bay doors, though). And after that, maybe a <a href="http://makezine.com/projects/make-38-cameras-and-av/raspberry-pirate-radio/">pirate radio</a>...</p>
