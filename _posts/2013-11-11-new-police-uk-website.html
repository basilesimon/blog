<p>The new <a href="http://www.police.uk/">police.uk</a> was launched last week, with a lot of nice new features.<br />
This new portal aime to 'give the public even more access to information about crime problems and how they are dealt with their area.'<br />
The new interface looks quite simple and very modern, as is the new <a href="http://data.gov.uk/">data.gov.uk.</a> Among the new functions, we note:</p>
<ul>
<li>the email alerts to be notified of updates in crime data for their area</li>
<li>the possibility to compare different police forces to one another<br />

<li>and a bunch of crime prevention advices, of course.</li>
</ul>
<p>The most striking capability of the website is the possibility to create personalised 'crime maps'... that can be shared on social networks.<br />
Home Secretary Theresa May said that these 'detailed, street-level crime maps are one of the IT successes of this government.' She also describes the site as a new opportunity for citizens to 'hold their local police and wider criminal justice to account and ensure crime continues to be driven down.'</p>
<p>Other notable stuff: the featured apps. This is one of the open government's prowess: developers around the UK can use the <a href="http://data.police.uk">data</a> and the API provided by Police.uk under the Open Government Licence - this gift for journalists.<br />
However the main use of data for apps is mapping, as one may see when opening the <a href="http://www.police.uk/apps/">apps page</a>, some are fairly creative, like <a href="https://itunes.apple.com/app/crime-sounds/id499539545">Crime Sounds</a>, which is... fairly hard to describe. Just try it - it is creepy.<br />
It can be pretty scary to read that 4 violence and sexual assaults were reported last month in my street, but is is informative.</p>
<p>The reactions to this new tool are quite good, and the tweets we collected praise in particular the modern interface.</p>
