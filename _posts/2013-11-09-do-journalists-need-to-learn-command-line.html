<p>At the Mozfest London, Noah Veltman, a 2013 Knigh-Mozilla Fellow at BBC News, <a href="http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/65613277843/the-command-line-murders-teaching-the-terminal-with-a">organized a workshop to illustrate the benefits of using the command line</a>, named The Command Line Murders.</p>
<p>The main goal of the exercise was to solve a murder case by extracting bits of information and clues from a thousands of lines text file, using the command line.</p>
<p>As this workshop was attended by journalists, we must reflect again on the 2013 journalist's skills.</p>
<p>Noah Veltman's initiative comes just after the big row about '<a href="http://veltman.tumblr.com/post/64900530026/on-journalism-and-learning-to-code-again">should journalists learn to code?</a>'</p>
<p>And I am thinking here about myself and my fellow journalism students; because we read every day about new skills we should possess in order to be employable.</p>
<p>As illustrated by this workshop, the command line proves to be handy for manipulating huge, messy and dirty datasets which are too big for tools like Excel.</p>
<p>It is worth noting that much of what you can do with commands can also be achieved with a graphical user interface. But if you are very comfortable with the black screen of your terminal, the command line is way faster.</p>
<p>Plus, the command line forces you to reflect on what is being looked for; meaning when facing a huge amount of text not written to be understood (like messy data), one has to search, or sort the data; and to do that, to have something in mind.<br />
With command lines, things don't come at random: you have to look for them and to be precise.</p>
<p><strong>So is command line useful for journalists?</strong></p>
<p>These days, many questions are arising about the necessary skills of the modern journalist. Writing, photographing, editing, recording, filming, sub-editing... are already basics. And now we are talking about coding, designing, and in this case: command line.</p>
<p>Are we asking to journalists to be nerds/developers?</p>
<p><strong>Conclusion</strong>: The majority of datasets available on data.gov.uk can be handled with command line tools. It's up to you to decide for yourself if you could use a bit of command line in your workflow with this infographic.</p>
<p>No doubt that journalists working on computer-assisted reporting are using a bit of it, if only for Github or Google Refine, for example. For the others, it is a matter of curiosity... and geekiness.</p>
