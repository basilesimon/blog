<p>As I am just beginning my research about the "bedroom tax" with the <a title="The Centre for Investigative Journalism's website" href="http://tcij.org/" target="_blank">Centre for Investigative Journalism</a> and for <a href="https://twitter.com/paulbradshaw" target="_blank">Paul Bradshaw</a>'s Help Me Investigate blog, I went through some of the notes I took during a read on my Kindle:<br />
<a href="http://www.scribd.com/doc/121978096/The-Casebook-Investigative-Journalism-UNESCO" target="_blank">The Casebook - Investigative Journalism</a>, published by the UNESCO, edited by Mark Lee Hunter (the download is free!).</p>
<p>Here is a collection of quotes I collected and that I am trying to apply to myself at this very moment.</p>
<blockquote><p>Stop admiring these people so much. It’s a way of telling yourself that you can’t be like them. Stop asking why they do the job, and start asking how, so you can do it too.<br />
(...)<br />
The only promise you can surely keep is to tell the story.<br />
(...)<br />
But if you don’t believe that telling the true story matters, whether or not you get a material result, you should do something else with your life.<br />
(...)<br />
If you don’t know what you’re looking for, you’re not likely to find it.<br />
(...)<br />
In investigation, the writer matters less than the subject, and serves the subject, or the subject is not worth doing.<br />
(...)<br />
Two vital things: You can figure out a story before you know all the facts, and you can tell it in about half the words you used.<br />
(...)<br />
Conclusions: Work till your last minute; believe in your luck and search for trustworthy contacts. Start with documents, ask experts, than speak to those involved and try to understand them. Do not believe anything before you have seen and felt it. Try to understand the entity behind an appearance.</p></blockquote>
