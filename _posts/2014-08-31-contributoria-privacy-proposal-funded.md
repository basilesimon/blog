title: My Contributoria proposal has been funded!
---

Thanks to the 13 generous people kind enough to back my proposal on Contributoria, ["Who's taking care of protecting your privacy?"](http://journalism.basilesimon.fr/2014/08/11/contributoria-who-is-taking-care-of-protecting-your-privacy/), I will be able to dedicate some time next month to meet and interview these people who did not choose to stand still when evidences of breaches in our privacy were provided.

I am particularly happy about this funding. It will allow me to fly to Switzerland for a day in order to meet with a source, and I will finally be able to buy a decent audio recorder, to publish more material.

Thank you all!
