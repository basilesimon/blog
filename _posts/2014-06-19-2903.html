<p>#Responsive videos made easy</p>
<p>Github is definitely a nice place to be around. Following people leads to lucky discoveries.<br />
This morning, <a href="http://twitter.com/padenot">Paul Adenot</a>, software engineer at Mozilla, and specialised in audio and video, <a href="https://github.com/padenot/talk-rich-media">published a new repo</a> with the content of his talk about rich audio and video on the web.</p>
<p>The talk can be accessed at <a href="http://padenot.github.io/talk-rich-media/">this address</a>, and it's a short delight.</p>
<p>While I was quickly going through it, I stumbled upon the slide about responsive videos without Javascript - and, of course, it rang a bell.</p>
<p><strong>Basically, CSS media queries now work on the <code>&lt;video&gt;</code> element.</strong></p>
<p>Without going through the codecs question (addressed earlier in the talk), you can add a media property to your HTML5 videos, like that:</p>
<pre><code><br /><br /><video controls> 
  <source src="retina.webm" media="(min-resolution: 300dpi)"> 
  <source src="desktop.webm" media="(min-device-width: 769px)"> 
  <source src="mobile.webm" media="(max-device-width: 769px)"> 
</source></source></source></video>


</code></pre>
<p>Easy, right?</p>
