Stuff I found today: this [blog post](http://www.tomski.com/archive/new_archive/000063.html), by Tom Loosemore: The BBC's 15 web principles. 

The blog was posted in 2007, and the interesting question becomes: how well have we done since? Are we still abiding by these guidelines today?

###**1. Build web products that meet audience needs:** 
Anticipate needs not yet fully articulated by audiences, then meet them with products that set new standards. (nicked from Google)

###**2. The very best websites do one thing really, really well:** 
Do less, but execute perfectly. (again, nicked from Google, with a tip of the hat to Jason Fried)

###**3. Do not attempt to do everything yourselves:** 
Link to other high-quality sites instead. Your users will thank you. Use other people’s content and tools to enhance your site, and vice versa.

###**4. Fall forward, fast:** 
Make many small bets, iterate wildly, back successes, kill failures, fast.

###**5. Treat the entire web as a creative canvas:** 
Don’t restrict your creativity to your own site.

###**6. The web is a conversation. Join in:** 
Adopt a relaxed, conversational tone. Admit your mistakes.

###**7. Any website is only as good as its worst page:** 
Ensure best practice editorial processes are adopted and adhered to.

###**8. Make sure all your content can be linked to, forever.**

###**9. Remember your granny won’t ever use “Second Life”:** 
She may come online soon, with very different needs from early-adopters.

###**10. Maximise routes to content:** 
Develop as many aggregations of content about people, places, topics, channels, networks & time as possible. Optimise your site to rank high in Google.

###**11. Consistent design and navigation needn’t mean one-size-fits-all:** 
Users should always know they’re on one of your websites, even if they all look very different. Most importantly of all, they know they won’t ever get lost.

###**12. Accessibility is not an optional extra:** 
Sites designed that way from the ground up work better for all users

###**13. Let people paste your content on the walls of their virtual homes:** 
Encourage users to take nuggets of content away with them, with links back to your site

###**14. Link to discussions on the web, don’t host them:** 
Only host web-based discussions where there is a clear rationale

###**15. Personalisation should be unobtrusive, elegant and transparent:** 
After all, it’s your users’ data. Best respect it.
