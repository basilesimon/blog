title: Cycling - 1pm

Instead of a usual 9am ride, I got to pedal my way down to Borough at around 1pm today. Bliss.

No hordes of commuters (including yours truly) and traffic jams; the city was a delight to pass through.

A bit of rain to keep the casuals in the Tube, the occasional man in a (white, always white) van going about their business witout bothering to indicate too much, a handful of battered cycle couriers that the weather won't stop.

I didn't even have to dodge u-turning black cabs and pedestrians through Bishopsgate.

Just kidding.
