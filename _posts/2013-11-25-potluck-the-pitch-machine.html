title: Potluck, the pitch-machine
---
<p>Pitches are journalists' drug. We love them, we hate them, we try every day to get some, we ask for some every time we want a good story.<br />
There's no such feeling as having a good one to give to the editor at the morning briefing. Oh, the satisfaction to get everybody on your hook in ten seconds.</p>
<p>They're short, they go fast, they're like shots at a party. We don't have time to tell our 2,000 words story in details - nah, we just want to have a shot. 'What is the news? Why should I care?' make sense in one or two sentences.</p>
<p>New link-sharing service Potluck is all about that. Well, that is technically not true. Potluck is Josh Miller's third try to make "people who aren't blogging or tweeting" voice their opinion, and the app is built around the commenting section - which some call a revolution.</p>
<p>But thinking as a journalist, that is a way you could use Potluck: being fed pitches in seconds, just by reading news stories that look like three swipable cards.</p>
<blockquote><p>We think there’s a huge demand for a mobile application where you don’t have to wait for anything to load, where the content is easily digestible, where you can very quickly learn about what’s going on in the world while you’re taking a bathroom break or in line at the grocery store.</p></blockquote>
<p>Of course, that assumes that every story can be told in three sentences.</p>
<p>The main problem of Potluck is that for now, the content is managed by the editorial team, meaning that stories you read are already mainstream and probably #old. It is also unclear if the content will spread quickly (like tweets) or not.</p>
