# From the streets to business

When we arrive at Cape Town airport, Bradley is there, waiting at international arrivals, holding a sign with our names. He looks very smart with his shiny black shoes and his casual smart bright clothes, contrasting with the deep brown of his skin.

The road from the airport to Cape Town's Central Business District heads east and is called Settlers Way - it changes to Nelson Mandela Boulevard when approaching the city centre. Bradley knows this fraction of the 1,400 miles-long motorway,  better than most: he grew up in Bridgetown, one of the townships adjacent to the road. As we drive by, Bradley explains the names and histories of each of the neighbourhoods and townships we see through the windows.

We also talk about how he came to create his driving and tour guide business, in partnership with a social innovation outfit called RLabs, also located in Bridgetown. Both his activity and RLabs' started around 2007-2008, and through them, Bradley explains that he was “born again.”

Bradley's life has nothing ordinary [to a European maybe - but not uncommon for someone growing up in a tough township] . His father, shot to death when Bradley was two, had created a major gang “The Americans”, now more than 10,000-strong and reportedly one of the West Cape's most important mafia.

Bradley Naidoo grew up in that same world, both a gangster and a drug-addict. Today he speaks calmly of times long past but never forgotten. One day, he says, Jesus spoke to him. He managed to quit gangs and drugs by changing his lifestyle completely, and instead started doing social work and programmes to take others with him: away from the gangster’s life, and closer to God.
Bradley explains that only this radical lifestyle change had saved his life. Our lively talk in his car  revolves around  hope, change, opportunity, community, and learning.

# The RLabs mission

RLabs ('Reconstructed Living Labs') was created in 2008 by Marlon Parker, is housed in one of Bridgetown's residential area, next door to a couple of schools. Marlon describes RLabs' ambitious mission as being“to impact, empower and reconstruct local and global communities through innovation.”

At RLabs, we meet a flock of young black people, most aged 18 and 25, working in rooms whose walls have been painted in bright colours, around small colourful tables. Some are coding and display stickers on their laptops, others are designing logos, and a couple are running around between the main room and the small radio studio before airing their daily show, streamed live on the space's loudspeakers.

Nobody but us seem to notice the activity. From Monday to Thursday, at 12pm, RLabs online radio streams a one hour-long show, with a different topic every day: Tech Tuesday, Wednesday Culture, Throwback Thursday. This Monday is Motivational Monday, and the two presenters chose to discuss the xenophobic attacks and violence taking place in Johannesburg at the moment, as well as the notion of living together in the Rainbow Nation. The loudspeakers fill the rooms with the radio show, which can also be listened to live in the RLabs Youth Cafés.

The radio, like almost everything here, is operated by members of RLabs themselves. Some host their own shows, some take care of the behind-the-scenes work to keep the station online. The Wednesday Culture show is about the culture of RLabs itself, takes a biblical quote, and actively involves listeners in what's being discussed during the programme: “I give my phone number on air, and people text me their comments or what they want me to talk about,” said one of the show's host. On Tuesday, the Tech show explains technology-related topics to the community in  - such as which budget tablet should you buy. Throwback Thursday looks at “RLabs back in the days” by interviewing people involved in the early days of the social structure.

Bradley Naidoo is one of those who was there at the birth of RLabs. His was also one of the “42,000 jobs created and filled” by RLabs, and he wants to join this effort as well. 

On several occasions during the week, one man we did not know rode in the minibus with us back to the hotel, helping us carry our kit and making conversation. “They're kids I want to help, you know, recovering addicts or who want to get out of gangs,” said Bradley. So he trains them at his job, that he likes to consider as being much more than a taxi driver. “I want to give you guys a glimpse at the culture of where you are, what this society and history look like. It's important to me.”

# Reclaiming a space

One of the two Youth Cafés that RLabs operates is just a couple of minutes away, but the area already feels quite different. Located just behind the surprisingly massive and European-looking Bridgetown Mall, it is easy for Bradley to find a parking spot in the shade but close enough to the Café.

At least 20 people are there, and there’s a buzzing activity everywhere you look. Much of the space is organised around a counter that displays tempting muffins, snacks and soft drinks. As in RLabs, the chairs, tables, and walls are colourful, and the light coming from the large bay-windows behind us bathes the space. Tablets and black laptops are on display on high tables, and just by the entrance, the walls are painted with graffiti - the biggest, central one is the word “HOPE.”

Edson, a handsome young man wearing a Christian cross and fancy hipster clothes, grabs us to give us a tour of the café. He went through RLabs Academy, and now does facilitation. He’s extrovert and confident, and takes us to several different areas, each time introducing us to people, including his girlfriend, who also does facilitation.

He explains enthusiastically how this café is used by young people as a working space, a place where friends meet up, and also as a training and teaching facility. A large glass room  hosts workshops - attending this course (whose topics changes every week) is another way to get Zlatos.
Even the bathroom looks amazing, mixing modern dark-grey matte paint with white messages and a chandelier. Their heavy doors are made of corrugated iron. “It represents the townships and the shacks,” says Edson. This is how these young people reclaim symbols of their community and even architectural clichés. “This is our space, I'm proud of where I come from - with this corrugated iron, I feel at home, that's mine.”

He’s proud to show us around . “We now have a space that is ours, just for us,” he explains. He introduces us to the "mother figure,” who runs the space and trains the baristas to properly make one of South Africa's famous coffees - whether the widely popular cappuccino, an espresso, or a latte."

# The 'Back to Work' currency

Before we leave the Youth Café, we spot a large TV screen at the back, displaying a colourful and modern dashboard, with loads of numbers and charts. This is the monitoring space of Zlato, the virtual currency created and operated by RLabs.

Renée, a middle-age woman, talked us through the currency when we first arrived at RLabs. She didn’t even take the time to drop her grocery bags before greeting us and chatting throughwhat makes RLabs so special.

“The idea is that if you do good, you get Zlatos,” she told us. These tokens have various uses - the most popular ones being buying sandwiches, muffins, juice, tea and coffee at the Youth Cafés, according to the dashboard. The currency operates in a close-circuit environment, as Zlatos can only buy certain goods and services. A haircut before an interview is okay, as is a new shirt or a train ticket to go to the interview. As you would expect, alcohol or new trainers cannot be purchased with Zlatos.

Zlatos are earned by "doing good deeds in [the] community or attending skills and personal development training," says RLabs founder Marlon. He summarises the “back-to-work” philosophy behind Zlato as being  "to provide unemployed and underemployed youth with resources allowing them to take hold of opportunities that will enable them to be economically empowered."  
All this while keeping the focus around the community.

# A complex society

Back at RLabs, the sun is setting and casting its warmth on the mountains that surround Cape Town , and which are visible from almost anywhere in the city. We ask about the informal settlement, Langa, at the end of the road, just over the motorway. Are people there joining RLabs as well? Do they come to the Cafés?

Simone, one of the RLabs members, looks embarrassed by this naive question. At first, she doesn't know what to answer, but explains that it is very hard even for them to reach out to these people. Bradley explained that the motorway was built here for a purpose: “it doesn't split the communities apart, it just separates them from one another,” he says with regrets in his voice.

Only a few from Langa make it across Settlers Way, whether to go to school or join RLabs projects. The two areas are dissimilar in a number of ways: where Bridgetown looks quite residential, featuring built houses and small gardens, Langa is still mainly shacks. A recent housing development at the end of the neighbourhood aims to relocate people in proper houses. But this project, according to Bradley, despite being one of the first of its kind, doesn't work quite as well as expected by the government. “People don't want to pay rent when they can live here for free,” he explains.

The populations living in the two areas are also very different: Langa is more than 99% Black African and 0.4% Coloured or mixed race, whereas Bridgetown is 82% Coloured, 8.5% Black African and 1.1% White.

Despite these massive differences being not obvious to foreign visitors, even a self-described Afrikaner we met at RLabs confused the two neighbourhoods when he was talking over the phone.

# A social revolution

As our last day in South Africa approaches, we discuss with Bradley our plans before a  12 hour flight back to London. He would like us to take what he calls a “gangs tour,” which he operates from behind the wheel of his minibus. He wants to show us around certain neighbourhoods, and for us to see the houses where some still do drugs, and trade weapons. He is offering us a glimpse of yet another South Africa: the rough and crime-ridden side.

For Bradley it’s a form of redemption to show us what his former life looked like. A reminder of what and where he comes from, and how much good can be done by the community, by outfits such as RLabs, and through strong will, chances and opportunities - and God.

All of these values resonate through RLabs. “To give hope and make a difference. A movement of hope, change, opportunity, learning, innovation. It is a social revolution.”
