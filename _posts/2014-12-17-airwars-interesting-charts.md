## Weapons releases v. Intel, Surveilland, and Recon sorties

This group of charts compares the two current US operations in the Middle East:

* Operation Enduring Freedom, in Afghanistan,
* And Operation Inherent Resolve, in Iraq and Syria

### Weapons releases
On the left-hand chart, I have plotted the number of weapons released by American aircrafts on targets in Afghanistan (blue) and Iraq/Syria (orange).

One quickly notices the massive importance of the bombardments in Iraq and Syria: **in October only, 1,641 bombs dropped in Iraq/Syria, compared to 217 in Afghanistan.**

The total shows 1,182 weapons releases on Afghanistan, for 4,019 in Iraq/Syria

The scale of the operation Inherent Resolve is demonstrated by these figures - and that is partly why Chris and I decided to focus on it.

### ISR sorties
On the right-hand side, I represented the number of what the US call *Intelligence, Surveillance, and Reconnaissance sorties* - the name is rather self-explanatory: these are the reconnaissance missions which usually precede air strikes on the ground.

They provide information to the military about troops movements and potential targets.

Once again, it is very easy to notice that there is considerably much more ISR missions in Afghanistan than in Iraq/Syria. 5 to 10 times more, in fact. The total of ISR sorties in Afghanistan is 12,085, against only 1,622 in Iraq/Syria.

Now, this chart asks some questions regarding the quality of the intelligence the military gathers about what is on the ground, and what it targets with its bombs.

When comparatively so many bombs are dropped in Iraq/Syria with so few ISR sorties, the risk for non-combattants is obviously greater. That is also partly why we are focusing our attention on the claims of civilian casualties in operation Inherent Resolve.

## The dependance on US forces for this air war

These charts represent only strikes part of the Iraq/Syria air war, and paint a picture of the US-led coalition.

### US and partner nation
The Combined Joint Task Force - Operation Inherent Resolve (CJTF-OIF) and formerly CentCom refer to the category of "partner nation," that they describe as such:

> ‘U.S. Central Command’s decision to use the term “partner nations” and defer to those nations for public comment is necessary and appropriate as we have not been provided the authority to speak on behalf of our partners. Our current practice represents our best efforts to be transparent by acknowledging and accounting for coalition airstrikes, while at the same time honoring the rights and wishes of partner nations to announce their participation publicly in a manner of their own choosing.’

Certain countries are still named, though. France and the UK in particular are often named in the CJTF-OIF reports.

These two charts need to be compared to understand the subtility: while the chart on the left shows allied and US strikes together, **the one on the right plots in orange only the instances in which allied struck ISIS alone.**

Here again, the difference between the two charts is quite obvious. First, if some Arab countries ventured into Syria, it was only with the support of the US. They did not dare to go there on their own. Second, the proportion of strikes carried on by coalition partners on their own is very small compared to the ones carried on with US support.
