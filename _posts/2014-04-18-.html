<h1>Death folder</h1>
<p>Last year, I wrote an <a href="">article</a> about a young man whose suicide was announced to his father on Twitter. The news hit me as something that would never had happened only a couple of years before. But also, while doing my research, I became aware of <a href="">Facebook's policy on deaths</a>:<br />
<em>a perpetual memorialisation of the account.</em></p>
<p>That was scary. That disturbed me a lot. I couldn't help but wonder: <em>what would happen if I was to die tomorrow?</em><br />
These are dark thoughts for a kid like me, but meh.</p>
<p>I decided to do something, and I looked for a solution to empower my family to manage and terminate my online life if I wasn't able to do it myself. A sort of electronic euthanasia, if you like.<br />
I've always been concerned with what happens after death. I do not know much about the topic, but I think I know what I would like for mine: that certain things go the way I wanted them to go after me.</p>
<p>So here I am, thinking of a solution to this new problem that emerged recently.</p>
<h2>Content</h2>
<p>The first thing to do is define what will be included in this <em>folder</em>, i.e. what do I want to leave behind.</p>
<p>Part of the answer is pretty easy, as it comes directly from my original intention: <strong>the folder has to include whatever is necessary to terminate my online life.</strong></p>
<p>So, I will include all the logins I can remember for my online accounts. This inludes Facebook, obviously, but also Twitter. Those are the two platforms I find the most macabre to look at when somebody passed away.<br />
All the details for my email addresses will be included, as emails are now the angular stone of our digital life.</p>
<p>I also want to facilitate the management of my money (this postulates that I left journalism and actually earned money somewhere, but I am planning wide, here). Hence, <strong>the folder has to include my bank details, both in France and overseas.</strong></p>
<p>The question of the power is here asked: companies that act in my name are entitled to refuse access to my data/possessions to my family in certain situation. That's why I pay my banker, after all, so me and only have access to my money. Obviously, this falls if a will is produced.<br />
So, I also need to <strong>include my will in my death folder.</strong></p>
<p>Now, the problem is that a will done by myself doesn't have much power, at least in French law, the one that will be applicable to my death, as I am a French citizen.<br />
I will consult somebody to solve this problem, but here is my idea: <em>by giving directives, instructions and will beforehand and in private, it will be much easier for my family to know what to do.</em><br />
If you're thinking that it's a technique to avoid taxes on my possessions, I couldn't possibly comment. Just think of somebody who expressed in front of everybody his desire to be buried not in the family grave, but in the town he was born in.</p>
<h2>Specifications</h2>
<p>Well, it is established that the content of this folder will be pretty sensitive, so I better make sure that I protect it correctly.</p>
<h3>Security is paramount</h3>
<p>For this reason, my death folder will take the form of an archive encrypted with TrueCrypt,</p>
