Despite my efforts (and dare I say desire) to set up a healthy and lasting freelance activity, I have applied to two permanent positions. The jobs in question are too interesting to not explore, but it's a little early to say more about them publicly for now.

I've also submitted a bid to the Prototype Fund! The project I proposed, which I may go into details later, will be an excellent occasion to go round the OSINT and human rights violations monitoring scene in Berlin and abroad -- as I've been looking for afar since I stepped back from my Airwars duties. It would also lead me to dip my toes into security and cryptography, which I'm well hopeful about. I wrote this bid in a few hours so I don't feel quite comfortable sharing. More on this in December, maybe!
