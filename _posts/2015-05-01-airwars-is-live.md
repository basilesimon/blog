Oops, it looks like I forgot to put a little blog here to announce that, finally, **[airwars.org](http://airwars.org) is live!**

Airwars is a non-profit project monitoring both the airstrikes produced by the US-led coalition against Islamic State in Iraq and Syria, and also the claims of civilian casualties arising regarding those strikes.

You will find [on the home page](http://airwars.org) a **set of charts and numbers that represent our current understanding of how the campaign is playing out over there.**

There is also a **large set of archived [reports from the militaries](http://airwars.org/daily-reports)** available, broken down month by month. You can refer to these pages, updated daily, for the latest updates about the war.

Next to come are more detailed **investigations about claims of civilian casualties**, as well as many new functionalities on the website.

**[Follow us on Twitter](https://twitter.com/airwars_) for the latest updates!**
