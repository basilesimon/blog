<p>Yes, that happens sometimes. I needed to find a story to write about, and as a result of such a common quest I found myself wandering on Google Trends. And I found something quite peculiar.<br />
I opened the '<a href="http://www.google.co.uk/trends/explore#cmpt=q">Explore</a>' page, desperate enough to see what other people were looking.</p>
<p>What a surprise:<br />
<script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TOP_QUERIES_0_0&export=5&w=300&h=300"></script> <script type="text/javascript" src="//www.google.com/trends/embed.js?hl=en-US&date=1/2013+12m&cmpt=q&content=1&cid=TOP_QUERIES_0_0&export=5&w=300&h=300"></script></p>
<p>This basically means that a huge majority (I can't overstate it) of internet users search for a page instead of going to the page, even if they know its adress. Yes, I am in shock. I thought that only my grandmother was doing it.</p>
<p>Are users dumb enough to do that? It seems extremely stupid and highly illogical to:</p>
<ol>
<li>search for 'facebook'</li>
<li>wait for the results from Google</li>
<li>click on facebook.com</li>
</ol>
<p>Josh Catone noted in 2008 that:</p>
<blockquote><p>Surprisingly, people actually often search for entire domain names rather than type them into their browser's address bar.</p></blockquote>
<p>And yes, people still do that in 2013. Progress, you said?</p>
<p>However, this weird interaction could be explained by the merging of the address bar and the search bar. I personally do not use the search box anymore, since Chrome introduced its "omnibox" in 2008, following the announcement of an "awesome box" for Firefox 3.<br />
Still, all the modern browsers offer autocompletion - meaning that after visiting facebook.com, beginning to type "fac" in your adress bar will propose you "facebook.com" and a direct access to the page. As a result of the autocompletion it was feared in 2008 that the search traffic would die:</p>
<blockquote><p>A potential issue with the address bar, for Mozilla, is that it decreases users' reliance on the search bar.<br />

<p>It did not happen, as far as I know.<br />
Still, I am confused by such irrational behaviours.</p>
