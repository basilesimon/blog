title: Airwars is go
---

Time for some updates about [this new project](http://blog.basilesimon.fr/2014/11/05/monitoring-airstrikes-against-is/) I talked to you about - **which name is now AirWars.**

I just finished converting Chris' long [Daily Strikes Report Google Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1zZ_frhfmliPKGwCWYRs7hffwahhPamx16CUvBeV2qJc/edit?usp=sharing) to a more data-friendly format. 

Soon, **I'll release the whole batch of data in [this Github repo](https://github.com/basilesimon/airstrikes-is-monitoring), as CSV**. Soon, too, we will have nice things to show you at [airwars.org](http://airwars.org).

The dataset has been designed to allow as many uses of the data as possible. Our first goal for AirWars is to present a graphical overview of the war against IS, as well as continuing to maintain this crucial dataset monitoring the strikes, and continue to hold the coalition's members to transparency and accountability.
