<p>I'm glad to be back, and with some good news.</p>
<p>Michael and I published a data-journalism project about the <a href="http://basilesimon.fr/projects/immigration/index.html">flows of migration in Europe</a>. The idea came from Michael, one night in our favourite pub. We drew the first sketches on the back of a bill, analogue-style.</p>
<p>The project is basically a compilation of public data from the national offices of statistics of ten European countries, and aims to paint a more precise picture of migrations on our continent.</p>
<p>It was the occasion for me stick my toes into Javascript for the first time, through the Canvas.js library, as I was just completing the Codecademy's JS course at the moment.</p>
<p>Still, many problems we had were caused by the library and by my limited skills in Javascript.<br />
For example, the arrows appearing when hovering the countries are PNG images, and not dynamically drawn SVGs. Nope, they're just stupid images refreshed with this small function</p>
{% highlight javascript %}
var dataPoints = chart.options.data[0].dataPoints;
  for(var i = 0; i &lt; dataPoints.length; i++){
     dataPoints[i].mouseover = updateBackgroundImage;
  }
function updateBackgroundImage(e){
  document.getElementById('chartContainer').style.backgroundImage =
  "url('" + e.dataPoint.imageUrl + "')";         
}
{% endhighlight %}
<p>Aligning them was quite a pain in the neck - as one can see when looking at the CSS. And let's not talk about the home-made responsiveness.</p>
<p>But in the end, the project may look like more hacking than proper development, but it works. And it works quite well, indeed!<br />
Showing it around allowed me to join the BBC News Lab, as well as the Centre for Investigative Journalism to work with Paul Bradshaw, and will maybe get Michael and I an internship in a well known and respected paper - that I'll not name here to avoid jinxing us.</p>
<p>The only regret we have is neglecting the journalism side of the story. We focused a lot of our efforts into the look and feel of the page, as well as the gathering of the data, and did not take the time to write a good story with an appealing angle.</p>
