Frédéric Bernheim, one of the guys who taught me how to use a camera and the love of journalism, passed away last week.

One of his relatives called me yesterday to ask permission to use some of the pictures I took while at Phaestos Presse, in August 2012. Naturally, I said yes.

From the gorgeously sunny city of Montpellier, Fred was a local correspondent, mostly for the 1pm TF1 bulletin, cherished by retirement homes across the nation (6 to 7 million tune in daily, a record in Europe for a midday broadcast).

Rest in peace, friend. Thanks for all your support and your tips.
