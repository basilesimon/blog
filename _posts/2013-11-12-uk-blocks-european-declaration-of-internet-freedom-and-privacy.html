title: UK blocks European declaration of internet freedom - and privacy
---
<p>As we learned that the UK is delaying - some will say 'blocking' - the <a href="http://www.theguardian.com/law/2013/nov/08/uk-blocks-attempt-council-europe-inquiry-online-spying">publication of a declaration of internet freedom</a> by the European human rights watchdog, it is once again hard to be anything but delusional.</p>
<p>This declaration was supposed to be the first move of the Council of Europe on this matter, after the Parliament announcend more <a href="http://euroblog.michaelertl.com/?p=72">legislation on privacy issues</a>.</p>
<p>Being called an "arrogant bad boy on the world stage" by director of Liberty Shami Chakrabarti, Britain still refuse to sign this political declaration which states that the Council of Europe will <em>"examine closely, (...), the question of gathering vast amounts of electronic communications data on individuals by security agencies, the deliberate building of flaws and 'backdoors' in the security system of the internet or otherwise deliberately weakening encryption systems."</em></p>
<p>This news is more than sad for Britain's government as for citizens concerned by privacy. However it is worth noting that this rather hypocritical move is not bothering many.</p>
<p>After the big fuss about knowing how Edward Snowden was going to get out the Russian airport terminal, it seems that the substance of his leaks are not very appealing to the public. We prefer talking about Snowden-superstar and his international escape from the US rather than, finally, our privacy.</p>
<p>This text was supposed to be the first coordinate political move against rogue intelligence agencies, and it is so far in the death row because of the UK and the GCHQ - which is, for dummies, the little brother of the NSA. This is just sick.</p>
<p>And franckly, I am beginning to think like JD Rucker, who published on Medium '<a href="https://medium.com/editors-picks/ed6c276ae808">Stop Thinking the Government Can Fix Privacy</a>'</p>
<blockquote><p>[Politicians] won’t fix it. They can’t fix it. (...) It would take an upheaval of revolutionary levels in order to fix things from the top down and that simply isn’t going to happen. It can’t happen in America. It can’t happen in Europe. It is possible in some countries where the people hold enough anger towards their government that they’re willing to lose everything in order to gain something else, but they have <a href="http://www.middleeastmonitor.com/news/middle-east/8158-syrias-muslim-brotherhood-launches-political-party" target="_blank" rel="nofollow">bigger problems</a> to worry about than whether or not someone knows who they emailed last week.</p></blockquote>
