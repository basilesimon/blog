# Hi

<img src="https://basilesimon.fr/img/prof.jpg" width="300px" align="left" style="padding-right:1em;"/>

I'm a graphics editor at [Reuters](https://graphics.reuters.com/), working on bespoke interactive content and data nerdery. Sort of.

Despite this incertitude about what it is I do, I am a visiting lecturer in Interactive Journalism at City University, London, trying to pass on whatever knowledge I've got to postgrad students.

I'm also chasing bugs and designing the datasets at [Airwars.org](https://airwars.org), monitoring anti-Daesh Coalition strikes and claims of civilian casualties.

Part of the content of this blog is [syndicated and contributed to R-Bloggers](https://www.r-bloggers.com), the most important hub of R knowledge. Thank you to them.
