# Hi

<img src="https://basilesimon.fr/img/prof.jpg" width="300px" align="left" style="padding-right:1em;"/>

I'm a newsroom developer at [The Times and Sunday Times](https://thetimes.co.uk), working on bespoke interactive contentand data nerdery. Sort of.

Despite this intence incertitude about what it is I do, I am a visiting lecturer in Interactive Journalism at City University, London, trying to pass on whatever knowledge I've got to postgrad students.

I'm also chasing bugs and designing the datasets at [Airwars.org](https://airwars.org), monitoring anti-Daesh Coalition strikes and claims of civilian casualties.

I fancy data, coding, the internets, and Belgian beers. Also, all things drones, infosec and natsec.
